## How to Update to New Versions?

Please refer to the [User Guide](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme/blob/master/create-react-app-USERGUIDE.md#updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.

## Philosophy

-   **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

-   **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

-   **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

-   React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
-   Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
-   Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
-   A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
-   A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
-   A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
-   An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme/blob/master/create-react-app-USERGUIDE.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria.
-   Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

Check out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can ["eject"](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme/blob/master/create-react-app-USERGUIDE.md#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.

## Popular Alternatives

Create React App is a great fit for:

-   **Learning React** in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.
-   **Starting new single-page React applications.**
-   **Creating examples** with React for your libraries and components.

Here’s a few common cases where you might want to try something else:

-   If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html).

-   If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails or Django, or if you’re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible.

-   If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).

-   If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and just produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.

-   If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) instead. Unlike Create React App, it pre-renders the website into HTML at the build time.

-   If you want to use **TypeScript**, consider using [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

-   Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).

All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.

If you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html).
